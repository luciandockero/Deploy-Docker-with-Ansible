In this assessment I deployed an app container with Ansible to a remote virtual machine.
The "inventory" file served as inventory, while the "playbook.yml" file served as an Ansible playbook.
The "video_demo.mp4" file serves as a demonstration of the assessment.

I'm aware that I didn't configure the port in which the application runs via inventory and that
I haven't managed to deploy the database container, but I will continue to search solutions
for these requirements.

Thanks for your attention!
